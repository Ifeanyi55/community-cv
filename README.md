- Developing and presenting interactive reports on the analysis of keyword queries on Twitter in web-hosted HTML documents and dashboards.
  
## **Application Motivation**
My primary motivation for applying to the Google Developer Expert (GDE) program is to use our unique platform as a programmer, data scientist and developer to collaborate, learn and create tools that improve workflows for a wide audience, especially non-technical users. . I believe technology should be accessible and my passion is creating solutions that bridge the gap between complex systems and everyday usability.

With an insatiable thirst for knowledge, I see the GDE program as a great opportunity to connect with industry leaders, gain valuable insights and hone my skills. I will have the opportunity to deepen my expertise in areas such as AI, machine learning and data-driven development while learning from Google's ecosystem of innovative technologies.

I am also very passionate about mentoring and sharing knowledge with the community, especially aspiring developers and data scientists. Through this program, I hope to help others better understand technology and use it more effectively. Through tutorials, lectures, hands-on collaboration, and more, I want to support others in reaching their potential.

Participating in the Google Developer Experts program not only allows me to grow, but it also allows me to give back by contributing to the development and success of others in the community.

## **Activities Outside of My Regular Work**
### **Open-Source Projects in collaboration with The Social Media Research Foundation**

I have an ongoing collaboration with [The Social Media Research Foundation](https://www.smrfoundation.org/) to build open-source data importers for their [NodeXL](https://nodexl.com/) social network analysis software. Together, we have built and deployed the following 2 software, which on average gets around 500 monthly active users, with several other open-source projects in the pipeline:
- [Spotify4NodeXL](https://spotify4nodexl.netlify.app/)
- [OpenAlex4NodeXL](https://openalex4nodexl.netlify.app/)

The Spotify4NodeXL project aims to allow users to query the Spotify API for related artists' data and collaboration data, which can then be loaded into NodeXL for network analysis. Given that Spotify is not inherently a social media platform, this project required significant creativity and ingenuity to extract meaningful network data from user behavior on Spotify. I handled the data engineering aspect of the project as well as its frontend.

The OpenAlex4NodeXL is designed to empower non-technical NodeXL users by enabling them to collect scientometric data from [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) in a format easily importable into NodeXL for visualization and scientific analysis. In addtion to the web application, the GitHub repository for this project also features a Jupyter notebook that users can run to fetch the necessary data effortlessly. As in the Spotify4NodeXL project above, I handled the data engineering and frontend of the web application.

In recognition of my contributions to these projects, The Foundation created a page for me on their website, which you can access [here](https://www.smrfoundation.org/staff-member/ifeanyi-idiaye/).

### **Open-Source Contributions to the Gephi community**

I built and deployed the [OpenAlex4Gephi](https://openalex4gephi.netlify.app/) to assist non-technical [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) users, majority of whom are researchers and social scientists, to easily collect scientometric data from OpenAlex.org and import it into Gephi for visualization and analysis. The project receives an average of 500+ active monthly users. The GitHub repository of the project has received **10 stars** so far, and you can access it [here](https://github.com/Ifeanyi55/OpenAlex4Gephi).

I created a GitHub repository of useful datasets and visualizations for learning and mastering Gephi for beginners. The objective of this repository is to help beginner users of Gephi readily find high-quality ready-to-load datasets that they can use in their Gephi learning. The repository has garnered **8 stars** so far, and you can access it [here](https://github.com/Ifeanyi55/GephiDatasets) 

### **Open-Source PDF to Word Converter**

I developed an open-source R package wrapper for the Python pdf2docx module, which enables R developers to easily convert their PDF files into Word with few lines of code. The package is called [Convert2Docx](https://github.com/Ifeanyi55/Convert2Docx), and it has received **10 stars** on GitHub.

### **Open-Source Spaces on Hugging Face**

I have created and deployed over [30 open-source spaces](https://huggingface.co/Ifeanyi) on Hugging Face. All the code that was used to build the applications running in these spaces are completely accessible to the general public, and anybody can raise an issue or submit a pull request on any of the public spaces.

### **Contribution to Python's Gradio Module**

As an ardent Python [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/guides/quickstart) user, I was eager to demonstrate how to port the module into the R programming language. Therefore, I created a GitHub repository ([Gradio-in-R](https://github.com/Ifeanyi55/Gradio-in-R)) demonstrating how to install and use the module in R to create Gradio web frontend for R code. The project was shared with Gradio's discord community and it was well-received. 

I then created and submitted a pull request to the official Gradio repository, which was merged by Gradio's maintainers. I also made a review and 11 commits on the repository. Gradio 5 documentation will incorporate my contribution when it is released.

## **Technical Writings**
